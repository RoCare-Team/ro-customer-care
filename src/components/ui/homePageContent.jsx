            <section>
                <p>
                    A water purifier is one of the most trusted instruments used to eliminate infections present in the water.
                    Installing a purifier ensures infection-free water regardless of the source.
                    However, installation alone is not a permanent solution. If you are concerned about the quality of your
                    drinking water, you should get your purifier serviced regularly. Drinking untreated water can expose you
                    to harmful salts and microbes, which may cause various health problems.
                    Therefore, it is recommended to always drink pure water, and this can only be achieved with an
                    advanced water purifier installed at your doorstep.
